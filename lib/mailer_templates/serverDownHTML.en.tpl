Hi there,

Jetpack Monitor is on the job, keeping tabs on %url%. During our last check on %date_and_time%, we noticed that your site was down.

If you’re concerned about your site’s status, you might want to get in touch with your hosting provider. We’ll continue keeping track, and will let you know when your site is up and running again and the total downtime.

Cheers,
The Jetpack Team
