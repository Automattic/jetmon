Hi there,

We’e following up on the recent Jetpack Monitor alert we sent. It appears that your site is still down, and has been for %downtime%.

At this point, you’ll probably want to reach out to your hosting provider to determine the cause of the outage. Feel free to contact us as well; if there’s something we can to do help, we’re happy to lend a hand.

We’ll continue monitoring your site, and will let you know when it’s up again.

Cheers,
The Jetpack Team
